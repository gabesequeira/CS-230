Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  My client was called the Gaming Room. My task was to imprve the functionality of an existing Android game, Draw It Or Lose It. In my first project and subsequent projects after, I did just this by expanding it out to be able to run on multiple operating systems/platforms. Something I did well was explain why I made the decisions I did regarding software and hardware as well as other important components such as memory/storage and security.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  It helps you know which steps to follow in what order, and keeps things modular, rather than trying to do everything all at once. It also helps to prioritize which tasks are most urgent by being able to see them all alongside of each other.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  The memory and storage document--I would make it more comprehensive.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I looked at what would be needed to build the game and tried to encapsulate it to run on multiple systems. It was of utmost importance that the game be useable to players of all stripes. Or else there is no point in a game.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I split up functionality and storage into separate parts so that it's easier to maintain such a program as this. Documentation is key.
